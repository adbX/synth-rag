Dear students,

This is an update on projects. We will finish providing comments, if any, on your mid-project reviews by tomorrow. We do not expect any major changes. If you don't see any comments (which will be the default), you should consider it as a sign that we are happy with your progress. 

We are also extending the deadline for final project report/materials submission to Dec. 7 11:59pm (which is the Sunday after the final). We hope this will give you more time to polish and complete your projects and focus on the final stress-free. As a reminder, here are the instructions on the final deliverables:

We expect a detailed report, the format of which is noted below The demo video and GitHub repo links (as well as the website, if applicable) should be in your project report, which will be created and shared on GRAIL i.e., nothing should be submitted through Brightspace.


Your report must contain the following sections. While we encourage you to make liberal use of GRAIL's agent or any other generative AI tool, you are ultimately responsible for the content. So it would be your responsibility to read the whole report, make edits and additions as necessary, and so on. We are not setting a length limitation (except on the abstract), but we don't want reports that are excessively long, so we are leaving it to your own best judgment to express yourself in the length that you deem appropriate. You can always look to some of the papers we covered in class (e.g., by Yidan today) for guidance if you're stumped on how long typical sections are:


Title (of your project): A concise and descriptive title that clearly communicates the project's focus.

Abstract (150-250 words): A self-contained summary of your project. It should briefly cover the problem you are addressing, the methods/approach you used, the key results, and the primary conclusion. Hint: this is a hard section to write, and GenAI really helps. However, it's helpful to write this section after you write the full report as it's a summary!

Introduction: Provide background on the problem you are tackling. Motivate why this problem is important and what you aim to achieve. State your project's objectives and give a brief overview of your approach and contributions.

Data: Describe the dataset(s) you used for your project. Mention the source, size, and main characteristics. Detail any preprocessing, cleaning, or augmentation steps you performed on the data. A diagram and some examples are also useful here.

Experimental Setup: Explain the technical details of your experiments. Describe what specifically you did, software/libraries used, and any important hyperparameter settings. Your goal is to provide enough conceptual information for someone else to reproduce your work. Also, specify the metrics you used for evaluation.

Results: Present the main findings from your experiments. Use figures, tables, and quantitative measures to clearly report the outcomes. This section should focus on what you found.

Discussion: Interpret your results. What do they mean? Discuss any limitations, challenges, or unexpected findings. This is where you analyze the significance of your results. Many people who are non-technical will skip to the discussion after the introduction, so it should flow in that way. 

Potential Future Directions: Suggest specific and concrete ways this project could be extended. What are the logical next steps? Are there any alternative approaches that could be explored?

Conclusion: Briefly summarize the entire project. Restate the problem, your approach, and your main findings. End with the key takeaway message from your work.

Supporting links: Here's where you provide links on the demo video and GitHub repo, and if required for your team or if applicable, the website. Make sure to check they are accessible without requiring special permissions e.g. try to paste in the links in a separate browser where you're not signed in.

We're excited to see what your final projects look like!
